Why we are calling any specific piece of code : Tightly coupled 


Coupling : coupling is measured by how much work is involved in changing something 
Coupling is very much important in building great software 

only constant in software is change ;

Business requirements changes 
Framework changes 
your code changes 

there we want loose couling as much as possible

we want to make functional changes as less code changes as possible 


java interfaces and spring framework help us with loose coupling
